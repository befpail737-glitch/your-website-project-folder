What makes the LOF450 exceptional is its dual certification: it meets both industrial (IEC/EN62368) and medical (IEC/EN60601-1 2xMOPP) safety standards. This allows customers to qualify one power supply for a wide range of products. Features like active PFC, extremely low leakage current (<0.1mA), and high efficiency make it ideal for medical instruments, industrial automation, and communication systems where performance and safety are paramount.</p></div><div class="product-specs"><h3>Key Specifications</h3><table><tr><td>Output Power</td><td>450W (Forced Air), 300W (Convection)</td></tr><tr><td>Available Voltages</td><td>12V, 15V, 24V, 36V, 48V</td></tr><tr><td>Safety Approvals</td><td>IEC/EN/UL62368, IEC/EN/UL60601-1</td></tr><tr><td>Leakage Current</td><td>< 0.1mA</td></tr><tr><td>PFC</td><td>Active PFC (>0.95)</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>5" x 3" x 1.47"</td></tr></table></div></div></div><div class="product-extra-details container"><div class="faq-section"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><details class="faq-item"><summary>What does 2xMOPP mean for medical applications?</summary><p>2xMOPP (Means of Patient Protection) signifies the highest level of electrical safety and insulation required for medical devices that may come into contact with patients. It ensures protection against electric shock even if one layer of insulation fails.</p></details><details class="faq-item"><summary>What is the difference between convection and forced-air power ratings?</summary><p>The convection rating (300W) is the maximum power the supply can deliver with only natural air circulation. The forced-air rating (450W) is the maximum power it can deliver when a fan provides a specified airflow (CFM) across the unit to cool it.</p></details></div></div></main><footer class="main-footer">...</footer><script src="../assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
