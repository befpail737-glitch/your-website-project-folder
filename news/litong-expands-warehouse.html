                <h1>Understanding Power Supply Derating Curves</h1>

                <p>One of the most common causes of premature power supply failure is neglecting to derate. A power supply's maximum output power is not always available under all operating conditions. Derating is the practice of operating a component at less than its maximum rated power to ensure reliability. MORNSUN datasheets provide clear derating curves to guide this process.</p>
                
                <h2>1. What is Temperature Derating?</h2>
                <p>As the ambient temperature around a power supply increases, its ability to dissipate its own internal heat decreases. To prevent overheating, the maximum load you can draw from the supply must be reduced. This is shown in the "Temperature Derating Curve".</p>
                <p>Typically, a module like the <a href="../products/lm75-20b24.html">LM75-20B24</a> might offer 100% of its rated load up to 50°C. Above that, the curve will show a linear decrease. For example, at 70°C, you might only be able to draw 60% of the maximum load. Always design for your system's worst-case internal ambient temperature.</p>

                <h2>2. What is Input Voltage Derating?</h2>
                <p>Some power supplies, especially wide-input DC/DC converters, may need to be derated at the lower end of their input voltage range. This is because to deliver the same output power with a lower input voltage, the input current must increase (P = V * I). This higher current can cause additional stress and heating on the input-side components.</p>
                <p>The "Input Voltage Derating Curve" will show if you need to reduce the maximum output power when operating near the minimum specified input voltage.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Why It Matters</h2>
                <p>Properly applying derating based on the datasheet curves is not optional; it is essential for designing a reliable, long-lasting product. Pushing a power supply to its absolute limits without considering temperature and input voltage is a recipe for field failures. When in doubt, our FAE team can help you interpret these curves for your specific application.</p>
