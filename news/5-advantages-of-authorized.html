While MORNSUN modules are designed with excellent EMC performance, proper implementation is key to passing compliance testing. Here are five tips from our FAEs.</p><h2>1. Use the Recommended External Circuit</h2><p>The datasheet for most MORNSUN modules provides a recommended peripheral circuit for meeting specific EMI standards (e.g., Class A or Class B). This circuit, often consisting of capacitors, inductors, and common-mode chokes, is crucial. Do not omit it to save cost; it will likely cost more in re-testing and debugging later.</p><h2>2. Pay Attention to PCB Layout</h2><p>Keep the loop area of high-frequency switching currents as small as possible. Place input and output capacitors as close as physically possible to the module's pins. Use a solid ground plane to provide a low-impedance return path for currents.</p><h2>3. Ensure Proper Grounding</h2><p>Connect the 'FG' (Frame Ground) pin of enclosed power supplies directly to the system's chassis ground with a short, low-impedance connection. This is vital for shunting common-mode noise away from your circuits.</p><h2>4. Isolate Noisy and Sensitive Components</h2><p>Physically separate the power supply and its switching components from sensitive analog circuits or high-speed digital lines on your PCB. If they must cross, ensure they do so at a 90-degree angle on different layers to minimize coupling.</p><h2>5. Use Shielded Cables</h2><p>For input and output connections that are routed off-board, use shielded cables. Connect the shield to the chassis ground at the power supply end to provide a path for noise to be diverted away from the load.</p><div class="article-tags"><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="#">EMC</a>, <a href="#">EMI</a>, <a href="#">Design Tips</a>, <a href="#">Filtering</a></div></article><aside class="article-sidebar">...</aside></div></main><footer class="main-footer">...</footer></body></html>
