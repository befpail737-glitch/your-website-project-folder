                <p>Choosing the right distributor for MORNSUN products is as important as choosing the right component. A good partner provides more than just parts; they offer value that can streamline your development and procurement processes. Here are the key factors to consider.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Official Authorization is Non-Negotiable</h2>
                <p>Always verify that the distributor is officially authorized by MORNSUN. This is the only way to guarantee you are receiving authentic, factory-warrantied products and not grey market or counterfeit items. An authorized distributor, like LiTong, has a direct relationship with the manufacturer, ensuring full traceability.</p>

                <h2>2. Look for Strong Technical Support (FAE Team)</h2>
                <p>A reliable distributor invests in a skilled team of Field Application Engineers (FAEs). They can provide invaluable assistance during the design phase, help with component selection, and offer support for troubleshooting. This expertise saves you time and reduces design risk.</p>
